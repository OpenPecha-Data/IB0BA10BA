	<h2>The Gentle Rain of Benefit and Joy</h2>
<h2>An Explanation of the Practice of Sang Offering</h2>
<p><strong><em>by Gyalse Shenpen Taye</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Without ever straying from the absolute space of reality, beyond conceptual elaboration,<br/>
You appeared as the illusory manifestation of supreme, immaculate wisdomâlike the reflection of the moon in water,<br/>
Dancing playfully in an ocean of great blissâ<br/>
Glorious heruka LhatsÃ¼n, be my guide and care for me!</em></p>
<p>I shall now offer a brief explanationâword by wordâof the <a href="/tibetan-masters/lhatsun-namkha-jigme/riwo-sangcho">practice known as <em>Riwo SangchÃ¶</em></a>, which is part of the profound Dharma-cycle of <em>Rigdzin Sokdrup</em><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a>Â that originated as a pure vision in the treasure-like mind of the great and accomplished vidyÄdhara LhatsÃ¼n Namkha Jigme.</p>
<p>This will be divided into two sections: I) a brief explanation of the historical origins of the practice of smoke-incense (<em>sang</em>) offering; and II) a more elaborate discussion of the text in the form of a word-by-word commentary.</p>
<h3>I) A Brief Explanation of <em>Sang</em> Offeringâs Historical Origins</h3>
<p>It has been said by some that the practice of sang offering did not originate with teachings found in the sÅ«tras or tantras.</p>
<p>Others point to passages in the sÅ«tras referring to the Buddhaâs benefactors welcoming him with the burning of incense on their roofs, or by holding incense-burners in their hands. These, they say, describe the earliest form of the sang practice, as do the many similar references to be found in the tantras. Although we might classify these as offerings of sang incense to a supermundane deity, the type of sang offering we are concerned with here has an additional aspect, which is the focus on cleansing or purificationâas indicated by the so-called purification of impurity or contamination <em>(mnol bsang)</em> and the purification of spiritual pollution or blockages (<em>grib bsang</em>)âso it is difficult to identify these definitively as examples of genuine sang offering.</p>
<p>Still, if we speculate concerning the origins of sang, we can say that the first aspect of the practice [i.e., the aspect of offering] does accord with the authentic sources mentioned earlier. Then, regarding the second aspect, purification, we can say that generally since the victorious ones are skilful in methods and endowed with great compassion, they train beings by whatever methods are most appropriate in any given situation. In this case, the four naturally pure universal elementsâearth, water, fire and windâprovide numerous methods for purifying or cleansing the stains of both temporary and ultimate obscurations. The general principles of this approach may be illustrated by the householder ÅrÄ«guptaâs verses for purifying poisonous food.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a>Â Then there are also examples which illustrate the uncommon method of purifying poison using the poison itself, such as peacocks consuming poison or the technique of pouring liquid in the ear.<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a></p>
<p>Moreover, the texts of Secret Mantra teach countless methods of purification employing the individual elements, according to the particular experience and level of practitioners. The <em>kriyÄ</em> tantras, for example, teach rites of cleansing and ablution using earth and water. And the tantras, in general, teach a number of methods, such as pacifying rites that use fire, incense offerings carried on the wind and so on. The authenticity of this aspect of the practice is therefore beyond question.</p>
<p>We could also establish this point using logical reasoning, because there is no end to the buddhasâ enlightened activity on behalf of beings to be trained. In which case, this practice could be described as a method using the element of fire in particular in order to purify obscurations until all temporary and ultimate defilements have been cleared away.</p>
<h4>Historical Origins in Tibet</h4>
<p>In the past, there appeared three Dharma Kings who were emanations of the Lords of the Three Families. Amongst these, it was during the time of King Trisong Deutsen, who was MaÃ±juÅrÄ« in person, that the second buddha, the Great Master of Oá¸á¸iyÄna, was invited to the Land of Snows and the glorious, spontaneously perfect, unchanging temple of SamyÃ© was constructed. At that time, on one occasion the great Dharma King fell ill as a result of spiritual pollution. When this was reported to Guru Rinpoche, he replied that he had a method for dispelling the sickness. Clean wood was sought and then by purifying it through the element of fire, a smoke offering was made to the deities. The king recovered; and then, for the benefit of future generations, the instructions on sang offering, together with its history and a description of its benefits, were inscribed on the walls at Glorious SamyÃ©. This is renowned even today as the âSang Offering Mural of SamyÃ©â.<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> From that point on, texts of sang offering practices appeared increasingly.</p>
<p>The text to be explained on this occasion was revealed by the great LhatsÃ¼n Kunzang Namgyal, or Traktung Namkha Jigme, as he was opening up the sacred hidden land of Sikkim.</p>
<h3>II) A More Elaborate Discussion of the Text in the Form of a Word-by-Word Commentary</h3>
<p>The actual explanation of the meaning of the text has three sections: the beginning, the main part and the conclusion.</p>
<h3>1. The Beginning</h3>
<p>The beginning includes the sections of taking refuge, arousing bodhicitta, and gathering the accumulations through the seven branches.</p>
<h4>Taking Refuge</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Oá¹ Äá¸¤ HÅªá¹</em><br/>
<em>The heart essence of all the sources of refuge of saá¹sÄra and nirvÄá¹a, who are as vast as space,</em><br/>
<em>Powerful and wrathful vidyÄdhara Pema TÃ¶treng Tsal;</em><br/>
<em>Within your body, all that appears and exists is the perfect buddha maá¹á¸ala:</em><br/>
<em>In order to liberate all beings from saá¹sÄra, I take refuge in you!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The syllables Oá¹, Äá¸¤ and HÅªá¹ signify the three vajrasâthe enlightened body, speech and mind of all the buddhas. Begin by reciting these three syllables and, as you do so, recollect the qualities of what they represent.</p>
<p>Now, when commenting upon the meaning of this, using the words [of the root text], the first three lines may be explained in the following way:</p>
<p>There are two extremes which are feared by the ÅrÄvakas and pratyekabuddhas of the hÄ«nayÄna, and by the bodhisattvas of the mahÄyÄna respectively. They are the extreme of saá¹sÄric existence, as vast as space, and the extreme of the peace of nirvÄá¹a. The supreme sources of refuge with the power to protect from these two fearful situations are the perfectly enlightened buddhas. And of all the manifestations emanating from the wisdom that is inseparable from their enlightened minds, one is like the innermost heart-essence. Who is that? It is the one who has reached the level of a spontaneously accomplished vidyÄdhara, who has perfected the general activity of the victorious ones, and the activity of magnetizing and wrathful subjugation in particular. It is the one with the secret name of Pema TÃ¶treng Tsal. Here the text singles him out by the use of the second person pronoun, saying, ââ¦you, in whose body, appearance (the pure realms), and existence (the beings within them), are all the maá¹á¸alas of the buddhas, perfect by their own natureâ.</p>
<p>We take refuge in this precious masterâGuru Rinpocheâso that all beings, infinite in number, may be liberated from the vast ocean of saá¹sÄric existence.</p>
<p>Should you wish to elaborate further on this topic, you might also refer to the sub-categories of causal and resultant refuge.</p>
<h4>Arousing Bodhicitta</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I generate the awakened mind of bodhicitta, so that</em><br/>
<em>The three obscurations of all beings may be purified in the ground of the luminous tiklÃ© of supremely secret wisdom, and</em><br/>
<em>With the four visions spontaneously perfected in the tiklÃ© of the wisdom body, speech and mind,</em><br/>
<em>May they be liberated into the youthful vase body!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The general meaning of sang offering has been stated above. As a method for purifying temporary and ultimate obscurations through perfecting the two accumulations of merit and wisdom it is unlike any other. And so, it is here referred to as an extraordinary approach of the supremely secret mantra path. In terms of its view, the essence of both the illustrative and the actual luminosity is the inseparable union of bliss and emptiness. This is the great sphere, or <em>tiklÃ©</em>, of the expanse of primordial wisdom, wherein the âedgesâ or âcornersâ of any concepts related to the eight extremes have been eliminated. By resting in the state of realization arrived at through practising this method properly, merit is accumulated based upon the apparent luminosity, and wisdom is accumulated through the empty luminosity.</p>
<p>We make the aspiration that on the path, the obscurations of all beingsâincluding ourselvesâwill be purified in the fundamental ground of luminosity, indistinguishable from the primordial nature of all phenomena. When these three obscurationsâemotional, intellectual (or cognitive) and thirdly, a particular instance of the latter, the habitual obscurations of the three appearances of transferenceâ<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a> are purified, our own and othersâ body, speech and mind will be perfected spontaneously in the <em>tiklÃ©</em> that is inseparable from the vajra body, speech and mind of all the victorious ones. At that point, we will attain the fruition, the culmination of the ultimate path of Dzogpachenpo, and gain the extraordinary, uncommon experiences of the four visions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The vision of experiencing the nature of reality directly</li>
<li>The vision of increasing experience</li>
<li>The vision of awareness reaching full maturity</li>
<li>The vision of the dissolution [of ordinary experience] into the nature of reality</li>
</ol>
<p>The svÄbhÄvikakÄya may be likened to an expanse of sky. In which case, the liberation of the ordinary, gross physical body together with its ordinary experiences into the inner expanse of the youthful vase body, or into a body of clear light, is similar to the sky becoming clear of clouds. We make the aspiration to accomplish this however we can.</p>
<p>In this way, the relative bodhicitta, which includes the aspects of aspiration and application, and the absolute bodhicitta, are performed together. This wish to benefit ourselves and others on a vast scale incorporates all the essential points on bodhicitta.</p>
<h4>Gathering the Accumulations through the Seven Branches</h4>
<p>This section has seven parts. The first is the branch of prostration. The text says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To the primordial, unaltered nature of rigpa, I pay homage! And</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The innate condition of the mind is known as the wisdom of pure awareness; and its unaltered nature is the primordial luminosity. At the level of the ground, this is the original dharmakaya, whose self-radiance and power can be spoken of separately as the sambhogakÄya and nirmÄá¹akÄya. Then again at the time of the ultimate fruition, the three kÄyas are nothing other than the actualization of this very [primordial luminosity]. Thus, it is a sublime object of veneration. And it is to this that we perform this prostration, the homage directed towards our own inherent wisdom. âAndâ is a conjunction and connects this line with the next.</p>
<p>The second branch is offering. The text says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The luminosity, transcending limits and dimensions, I offer!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meditating on the meaning of the aforementioned dharmakaya luminosity, which is difficult to fathom and without centre or circumference, is the ultimate offering. From such a state, we then consider that we emanate ordinary offering substances like fresh water and so on until they pervade throughout the whole of space, just like the offering-clouds of the bodhisattva Samantabhadra. By making offerings like this, we will complete the two accumulations.</p>
<p>The third branch is confession of negativity. The text says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In the expanse of the sameness of saá¹sÄra and nirvÄá¹a, I confess!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the expanse of the luminosity explained above, all the phenomena of saá¹sÄra and nirvÄá¹a are equally lacking in self-nature. Since this is so, we use the four powers to confess all the negative acts and impairments of vows committed by ourselves and others throughout the past, present and future. Following this, we practise confession within the expanse of luminosity, realizing the absence of true reality. This is known as âConfession in the Expanse of the Viewâ and is the king of all confession practices.</p>
<p>The fourth branch is rejoicing. The text says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In the great exhaustion of all dharmas, beyond the ordinary mind, I rejoice!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As explained above, when we arrive at the culmination of the four visions that are unique to Dzogpachenpo, we are freed from the conceptualizing of the ordinary mind and all dualistic perception fades away. At that time, all the dharmas which might perpetuate saá¹sÄric existence, both manifest and latent, are exhausted, and we are liberated completely in the vast expanse of the primordial ground. It is in this inconceivable occurrence that we rejoice.</p>
<p>The fifth branch is requesting the turning of the Dharma-wheel. The text says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Turn the wheel of the teachings of the spontaneously perfect Dzogpachenpo!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All the points of the teachings of Dzogpachenpoâthe Great Perfectionâincluded within the three categories of ground, path and fruition, may be explained in terms of both primordial purity <em>(kadak)</em> and spontaneous perfection <em>(lhundrup)</em>. Although the text here emphasizes the appearance aspect of spontaneous perfection, this does not imply the exclusion of the aspect of primordial purity. So here the expression âspontaneously perfectâ is used to refer to the path of Dzogpachenpo as a whole. Making this request for the vast wheel of the teachings of this two-fold path to be turned continuously, we call upon the deities of the field of merit to listen and respond.</p>
<p>Sixthly, there is the branch of prayer. The text says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Stir the depths of saá¹sÄra, I pray!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we request the buddhas and bodhisattvas residing in the infinite realms throughout every direction not to pass into nirvÄá¹a, but to remain for as long as saá¹sÄra remains, and to stir saá¹sÄric existence from its very depths.</p>
<p>Seventh, there is the branch of dedicating virtue. The text says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In the absolute state, free of subject, object or activity, I dedicate!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We dedicate all the merit accumulated by all beings throughout the three times, represented here by the merit produced through the first six branches beginning with prostration, towards ultimately passing beyond suffering. We should perform the dedication out of a state that is unspoiled by any clinging to the true reality of the three conceptual spheres, i.e., the act of dedication, the virtues that are its object, and the subject, the one performing the dedication.</p>
<p>These are the seven branches, which include all the methods for completing the accumulations.</p>
<h3>2. The Main Practice</h3>
<p>Having finished our examination of the preliminaries essential to the sang offering, we move on to the actual practice itself. This has three sections: blessing of the offering substances, identifying those to whom the offering is made, and the manner in which the offering is made.</p>
<h4>Blessing of the Offering Substances</h4>
<p>The text says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>BhrÅ«m!</em><br/>
<em>In the vast lustrous vessel, made of the essence of various jewels,</em><br/>
<em>The samaya substances, all the desirable objects in worldly existence, are</em><br/>
<em>Transformed into the nectar of wisdom through the blessing of the three seed syllables Oá¹ Äá¸¤ HÅªá¹.</em><br/>
<em>So that all that appears and exists becomes an offering of all that is desirable.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Out of a state in which there is no focusing upon phenomenaârepresented here by the offering substancesârecite âBhrÅ«á¹â (pronounced âdroomâ) the seed syllable of the <em>Uá¹£nÄ«á¹£a Universal Monarch Tantra</em>. As you do so, consider that the <em>torma</em> container transforms into a vast and lustrous vessel made of the essence of various jewels and as large as the world itself. Inside it are all the desirable objects in worldly existence in the form of samaya substancesâthe five meats and the five nectars. Then visualize the three seed syllables Oá¹ Äá¸¤ HÅªá¹, one above the other, symbolizing the body, speech and mind of all the buddhas. Through the emanation and re-absorption of light-rays, the blessings of all the buddhas throughout the ten directions are gathered together and dissolve into the three seed syllables. They in turn become filled with light and start to melt. Mixing inseparably with the nectar they take on the essence of wisdom nectar and the form of offering goddesses in countless emanations. Through this blessing, consider that all phenomena included within the categories of all that appearsâthe outer environmentâand all that existsâthe beings within itâgather together, transformed into vast offering clouds of all that is desirable.</p>
<p>This was the identification of the offering substances.</p>
<h4>Those to Whom One Offers</h4>
<p>The text says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This I offer to the lamas, yidams, á¸ÄkinÄ«s, dharmapÄlas and</em><br/>
<em>All the mandalas of the buddhas of the ten directions,</em><br/>
<em>To the local deities of this world, beings of the six realms and the guests to whom I owe karmic debts.</em><br/>
<em>And especially to those who would steal my life and deplete my life force,</em><br/>
<em>To the malicious jungpo demons who inflict sickness and obstacles,</em><br/>
<em>Bad signs in dreams and all types of evil omens,</em><br/>
<em>The eight classes of negative spirits, the masters of magical illusions,</em><br/>
<em>And those to whom I owe karmic debts of food, place and wealth,</em><br/>
<em>To forces that bring obscuration and madness, to the shades of men and women dead.</em><br/>
<em>To all the spirits, terangs, ghouls and female ghosts!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here all the recipients of the offering are explained according to the categories of the four types of guest.</p>
<p>Firstly, there are the guests invited out of respectâthe Three Jewels. The glorious Lama, first of all, is the source of blessings and the embodiment of the Three Jewels. The yidam deities of the mandalas are the sources of accomplishment, and are included under the Buddha Jewel. á¸ÄkinÄ«s are included in the inner Sangha of vidyÄdharas. Then there are also the dharmapÄlas. In short, this includes all the inconceivable mandalas of buddhas residing throughout the infinite buddha-fields of the ten directions.</p>
<p>Then there are the guests invited on account of their qualitiesâthe protectors. This refers to the local deities of every place and continent, represented by those of our own continent of JambudvÄ«paâthe earth-lords, devas and nÄgas, the planetary and stellar forces, guardians of the directions, terrifying ones and great kings. There are also the seventy-five glorious protectors of pure abodes together with their retinues.</p>
<p>Next, there are the guests of the six classes invited out of compassion. This refers to beings wandering throughout the six classes, each tormented by their own particular sufferings, i.e., the gods, demigods, human beings, animals, hungry ghosts and hell-beings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are the guests to whom we owe karmic debt, and especially those who would steal our life-spirit, deplete our life-force or kill us. There are the malicious <em>jungpo</em> demons, beings who create obstacles such as sickness. And there are the arrogant spirits of this world who bring bad signs in dreams and all types of evil omens. There are the eight classes of negative spirits, the masters of magical illusions. And, in particular, there are those to whom we have not repaid our karmic debts, to whom we owe food, dwelling places, wealth and possessions. Furthermore there are those forces, male and female, that bring us impurity and obstructions. There are demons that cause insanity and illness. There are the ghosts of men and women who have died. There are the spirits of the dead included in the class of <em>pretas</em>, or hungry ghosts. There are the <em>terangs</em> and the ghouls who inhabit towns and other places. In short, the âkarmic creditorâ guests include all the obstructing spirits of the various classes of ghosts and demons, male and female.</p>
<h4>How the Offering is Made</h4>
<p>The text says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Now all my karmic debts are paid, burnt in the scarlet flames.</em><br/>
<em>Whatever each one desires, may the objects of their desires rain down:</em><br/>
<em>For as far and as long as space exists</em><br/>
<em>I dedicate an inexhaustible amount of sensual stimulants!</em><br/>
<em>May my negative actions and obscurations accumulated in past, present and future,</em><br/>
<em>And misuse of the offerings made to the Three Jewels, in devotion and for the dead,</em><br/>
<em>Be purified in the fire of this sang offering!</em><br/>
<em>Let its flames fill the entire universe and every minute particle of flame</em><br/>
<em>Become an inexhaustible cloud of offerings like Samantabhadraâs</em><br/>
<em>Pervading throughout all the buddha realms!</em><br/>
<em>May these flames, offering rays of five-coloured lights of wisdom,</em><br/>
<em>Pervade throughout the six classes of beings, down to the AvÄ«ci Hells,</em><br/>
<em>The three realms of saá¹sÄra be liberated into the rainbow body,</em><br/>
<em>And all sentient beings awaken into the heart of enlightenment!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever karmic debts we may have as a result, for example, of protection granted to us by our superiors, or reverence shown to us by our inferiors, they are all repaid through the offerings made to the scarlet flames: burnt away and purified. Through this act, all the different guests are satisfied, and they receive a great downpour of all that their minds desire. We dedicate this by saying:</p>
<p>âFor as far and as long as space exists, may this great shower of desirable objects rain down and become an inexhaustible supply of the five sensual stimulants!</p>
<p>âThrough the power of this dedication, may all our negative actions and obscurations of the past, present and future, particularly our misuse of offerings made to the Three Jewels, in devotion and for the deadâwhatever obscures us on the paths and bhÅ«misâbe purified completely in the fire of this sang offering!</p>
<p>âAnd similarly, let the flames of the sang offering fill the entire universeâthe whole of appearance and existenceâand may every minute particle of flame become a limitless and inexhaustible cloud of offerings like Samantabhadraâs, pervading throughout all the Buddha realms of the ten directions!</p>
<p>âAt the same time, from the tips of these flamesâvisualized as the five-coloured light of wisdomâmay multi-coloured rays of light appear emanating clouds of offering! May these rays pervade throughout the six classes of beings, but especially in the AvÄ«ci Hell of ultimate torment, and there may they bring cooling bliss and relief!</p>
<p>âMay all the negative karma, harmful actions and obscurations accumulated throughout saá¹sÄra without beginning be purified! May the three realms of saá¹sÄraâthe desire, form and formless realmsâbe liberated into the rainbow body! And may all sentient beings awaken into the heart of complete and unsurpassable enlightenment!â</p>
<p>Actualizing the visualizations that correspond to the recited text, recite Oá¹ Äá¸¤ HÅªá¹ one hundred, one thousand, ten thousand or one hundred thousand times or more.</p>
<h3>3. The Conclusion</h3>
<p>This has three sections: dedication, aspiration and requesting activity.</p>
<h4>Dedication</h4>
<p>The text says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>All is purified into the three kÄyas: the environment, a heavenly place where</em><br/>
<em>Dharmakaya, sambhogakÄya and nirmÄá¹akÄyaâappearance and the form aggregates of existence</em><br/>
<em>Melt into nectar, flooding the whole expanse of the sky with rainbow light.</em><br/>
<em>saá¹sÄra is liberated into nirvÄá¹a; this essence of immaculate nectar,</em><br/>
<em>I share with all those who, from beginningless time until now,</em><br/>
<em>Have been guests in worldly existence.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole of appearance and existence is pure in its nature of the three kÄyas. This is because the five elements of the outer environment (i.e. the âvesselâ) are, in their pure nature, the five buddha-consorts; the contentsâthe five aggregatesâare, in their pure nature, the five buddhas; and the eight consciousnesses of the mental continuum are, in their pure nature, the five wisdoms. Therefore, the vast and secret Akaniá¹£á¹­ha pure realm, which is the space of the five buddha-consortsâthe five elements of the outer environment in their utter purityâhas the nature of a palace. And the aggregates, elements and sense sources that are found within this sphere, are, in their purity, the mandalas of buddhas of the dharmakaya, sambhogakÄya and nirmÄá¹akÄya.</p>
<p>Inanimate appearance (i.e. the âcontainerâ that is the outer environment) and the form aggregates of animate existence are blessed and thereby melt into <em>amá¹ta</em> nectar (symbolizing the destruction of the mÄras), until no part remains unchanged. The steam and vapours from the amá¹ta* appear in the form of rainbow-coloured light, which floods the whole expanse of the sky, and saá¹sÄra itself is liberated into nirvÄá¹a. Through this method, we can amass immaculate virtue and, by doing so, overcome all our negative emotions. This is the quintessential âamá¹taâ, the virtue that we dedicate.</p>
<p>As for the objects to whom we dedicate, they are the guests in worldly existence who have wandered throughout the three realms of saá¹sÄra from beginningless time until nowâall sentient beings who have been our very own parents. We dedicate to them in a state that is free from the three conceptual spheres.</p>
<h4>Aspiration</h4>
<p>The aspiration appears in the next five verses. Firstly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Having attained all the noble qualities of the stages, paths and fruition,</em><br/>
<em>And dispelled all obstacles in view, meditation and action,</em><br/>
<em>Within the sky-like space of Samantabhadraâs wondrous wisdom mind,</em><br/>
<em>May we seize the stronghold of the youthful vase body!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through the power of all this accumulated virtue, may we attain all the noble qualities as we gradually traverse the five paths and ten stages which culminate in the ten strengths, four fearlessnesses and so on at the level of fruition! In this way, may we accomplish spontaneously the welfare of ourselves and others! May all obstacles in our view, meditation and action be dispelled! And ultimately, within the sky-like space of Samantabhadraâs wondrous wisdom mind, may we seize the stronghold of the youthful vase bodyâthe inner clarity that is âyouthfulâ because it is clear wisdom with its own powers perfectly complete, but is contained within âa vase bodyâ since it is not yet manifest.</p>
<p>Then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>And when at last the great ocean of saá¹sÄra is emptied,</em><br/>
<em>May all beings attain buddhahood in the Lotus Net of Akaniá¹£á¹­ha!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having attained complete enlightenment and secured our own wellbeing, we will go on to act uninterruptedly for the benefit of others. So we make the following aspiration: âWhen at last the great ocean of saá¹sÄra is emptied, may all beings attain buddhahood in the pure realm of Akaniá¹£á¹­ha, the untainted âLotus Netâ extending throughout the whole of space!â</p>
<p>The aspiration continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The sang offerings of the aggregates and elements blaze in vivid, brilliant splendour!</em><br/>
<em>The sang offerings of red and white bodhicitta blaze in bliss and emptiness!</em><br/>
<em>The sang offerings of emptiness and compassion fill the dharmadhÄtu!</em><br/>
<em>Upon the ground of five-coloured vajra light of phenomenal existence, saá¹sÄra and nirvÄá¹a,</em><br/>
<em>I offer the sang offering of spontaneously accomplished perfect buddhahood.</em><br/>
<em>May all my karmic debts from the past be purified!</em><br/>
<em>In the present so they do not remain in my mind-stream, I confess them!</em><br/>
<em>In the future, may I never be drawn into the wheel of obscuration!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Through making a sang offering of the impure aggregates, elements and sense sources as the blazing forms of peaceful and wrathful deities, our ordinary bodies are liberated into illusory enlightened forms of vivid, brilliant splendour. Through making a sang offering of the ordinary red and white bodhicitta in the fiery expanse of wisdom, the wisdom of the unity of bliss and emptiness blazes supremely. The sang offering of indivisible emptiness and compassion fills the dharmadhÄtu.</p>
<p>Upon the ground of the blazing five-coloured vajra light of all the phenomena of appearance and existence, saá¹sÄra and nirvÄá¹a, we perform this sang offering for the attainment of precious, spontaneously accomplished, perfect buddhahood. Through the power of this, may all our karmic debts from past lifetimes be purified! In the present, we confess our harmful actions and transgressions so they do not remain in our mind-streams. And in future, through this confession, may we never again be drawn into the cycle of obscuration!</p>
<p>The text continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>All impairments of the vows of individual liberation, bodhisattva precepts,</em><br/>
<em>And samayas of the vidyÄdharas,</em><br/>
<em>Conscious or unwitting, I openly admit.</em><br/>
<em>May illness, harmful influence, obscurations and impurities be purified!</em><br/>
<em>May this age of plague, famine and warfare be pacified!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The outer vows of individual liberation, the inner vows of the bodhisattvas, and the secret vows of the vidyÄdharas each have their own unique system detailing what is to be adopted and what is to be avoided. In the first of these it is primarily refraining from certain proscribed negative actions that is taught; in the second it is the precepts of accumulating virtue and maturing sentient beings; and in the third it is the various samaya commitments of the extremely secret mantra vehicle. We openly admit and confess all our impairments of these vows and commitments, incurred consciously or unwittingly. Through this confession, may all our illnesses, harmful influences, obscurations and impurities arising from the transgression of our vows and commitments be purified! May all the calamities of this age and place, such as plague, famine and warfare, be pacified!</p>
<h4>Requesting Activity</h4>
<p>The text continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>May the attacks of invaders be repelled!</em><br/>
<em>May the forces that create obstacles by inviting the spiritual teacher to leave this world be averted!</em><br/>
<em>May inauspicious bad omens for the land of Tibet be averted!</em><br/>
<em>May the planetary forces, nÄgas and arrogant king-like spirits, who cut short the breath of life, be repelled!</em><br/>
<em>May the eight great fears and sixteen lesser fears be overcome!</em><br/>
<em>For me and all those around me, may all that is inauspicious be averted!</em><br/>
<em>May the powers and strength of samaya-breakers and gongpo demons be averted!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>May the attacks of invaders, or of barbarian armies coming from the four border regions towards Lhasa in order to destroy representations of the enlightened body, speech and mind, or to carry them off as plunder, be repelled!</p>
<p>May all the forces that create obstacles by inviting spiritual teachers to leave this world for the realms of peace be averted!</p>
<p>May all inauspicious bad omens for the land of Tibet be averted!</p>
<p>May the planetary forces, nÄgas and arrogant king-like spirits, who so abruptly cut short the breath of beingsâ life, be repelled!</p>
<p>May the eight great fears of fire, drowning, wild animals and so on and the sixteen lesser fears be overcome!</p>
<p>May all that is inauspicious, for me and all those living around me, be averted!</p>
<p>May the powers and strength of obstructive samaya-breakers and the hosts of <em>gongpo</em> demons be averted!</p>
<p>When offering sang in this way, practise as indicated in the ritual for the fire offering, with 108 sang burners and various kinds of wood.</p>
<p>As for the benefits of this practice, the sang text says:</p>
<p><em>Through this diamond-like practice of Riwo SangchÃ¶, one will be able to âransomâ death, purify the misuse of offerings and avert the various kinds of obstacle. I, LhatsÃ¼n the illusory manifestation, wrote this without error in accordance with the á¸ÄkinÄ«âs instructions when revealing the hidden land of Sikkim.</em></p>
<p><em>Gya. Gya. Gya.</em></p>
<p>The explanation provided here may be applied to more elaborate or briefer versions of the sang offering text as appropriate.</p>
<p>It is in the lotus grove of the pure scholarly tradition of scripture<br/>
That the sublime masters take their pleasure and delight, but<br/>
For those continuously engaged in village ceremonies, this donkeyâs voice<br/>
May still provide some amusement with its garden of assorted advice.<br/>
From the stream of elegant sayings that benefit the teachings,<br/>
I have not taken even so much as a droplet on the tip of a blade of <em>kuÅa</em> grass,<br/>
Yet this garland of words that I have laboured to produce,<br/>
May still contain some moisture drawn from the clouds of Dharma.<br/>
Through the merit of this, may all beings<br/>
Find immediate relief from sickness, evil influence and fear of harm,<br/>
And ultimately, may they be freed from the torment of the negative emotions,<br/>
Always abiding by what is good and virtuous!</p>
<p><em>This explanation of sang offering, entitled âThe Gentle Rain of Benefit and Joyâ was composed in response to the request of one named Samantabhadra. Not having seen many histories like this before, and recognizing that people these days take special delight in this practice as a method for improving the conditions of their present life, it was done mainly to be of benefit at this particular time. I, the Dharma-preaching monk, Gyalse Shenpen Taye, wrote down quickly whatever came to my mind in my hermitage âThe Palace of Great Blissâ at the monastery of Rudam Orgyen Samten ChÃ¶ling.<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a> May virtue increase!</em></p>

<p>Â The story of the householder ÅrÄ«gupta is found in Khenpo Sangye Tendzinâs commentary to Sakya Paá¹á¸itaâs <em>Elegant Sayings (Sakya Lekshe)</em>. In the story, ÅrÄ«gupta is persuaded by a false teacher to set a trap for the Buddha and offer him some poisonous food. When the Buddha foils his plans, ÅrÄ«gupta is repentant, and the Buddha makes him repeat the following verse three times:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Attachment, aversion and ignorance,<br/>
These are the three worldly poisons,<br/>
The victorious buddhas possess no such poison.<br/>
The enlightened ones conquer poison through truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(This verse is then repeated with the Dharma and the Saá¹gha in place of âthe victorious buddhasâ.) And:</p>

<p>All that is poisonous,<br/>

All this arises from the poison of attachment.<br/>
Attachment is the greatest of all poisons.</p>
